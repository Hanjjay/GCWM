    "###### IQ Test\n",
    "\n",
    " - Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. \n",
    " \n",
    " - The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others. \n",
    " \n",
    " - Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. \n",
    " \n",
    " - Help Bob — to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)  \n",
    "\n",
    " - Examples :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "iq_test(\"2 4 7 8 10\") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even\n",
    "\n",
    "iq_test(\"1 2 1 1\") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd\n",
